# Vertiefungspraktikum Hess

This repository contains R scripts and workflows from my internship project at the Hess Lab.

## 📦 Project Description

This project involves the analysis of gene expression by segmentation of Mircroarray or RNA-seq data using Rcpp and other tools.
The code processes experimental data, performs segmentation using Rcpp, and visualizes the results using ggplot2.
